  <h2> Priyanka Oberoi, a Data Scientist in the Commerce Data Service, uses her expertise to answer tough questions. </h2>
  <p> “As a Data Scientist in the Commerce Data Service, which is a public startup in the Department of Commerce, I talk to teams across DOC and try to see how data science can be used to answer a question, improve a process, or measure an outcome. Since we are a small team, my responsibilities span the data science pipeline. This is a pretty hands-on process where we try to understand a problem, leverage data, implement statistics, and build something that has an impact. We build data products for teams within the agency, we teach data science courses to DOC employees through the Data Academy, and we push for data usability so our open data gets used by researchers, the private sector and non-profits.” </p>
